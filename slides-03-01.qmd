# CSC 110 - More on Functions in Python

## Function Comments

-   Every function created is required to have a function comment, including main
-   Function comments are a multi-line string (as opposed to using `#` for other comments)

## Function Comments

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

Class Demonstration
This program has two functions: one to calculate the area of a sphere,
the other to calculate the volume of a sphere.
The main() function is called to print to the standard output the
area and volume of a sphere of radius .75
'''
def sphere_area(radius):
  '''
  This function calculates the area of a sphere of given radius.
  Args:
    radius: integer representing the radius of the sphere
  Returns:
    The float representing the area of a sphere of the given radius
  '''
  area = 4 * 3.1415 * radius**2
  return round(area, 2)

def sphere_volume(radius):
  '''
  This function calculates the volume of a sphere of given radius.
  Args:
    radius: integer representing the radius of the sphere
  Returns:
    The float representing the volume of a sphere of the given radius
  '''
  volume = (1 / 3) * sphere_area(radius) * radius
  return round(volume, 2)

def main():
  '''
  This function prints the area and volume of a sphere of radius .75.
  Args:
    None
  Returns:
    None
  '''
  r = .75
  a = sphere_area(r)
  v = sphere_volume(r)
  print(a, v)
  
main()
```

## Global vs. Local variables (scope)

-   Every variable that is created has a particular scope
-   The scope of a variable is the region in the code where the variable can be used or modified

## Global vs. Local variables (scope)

-   **Local Variables** have local scope -- for example, a variable assigned inside a function can only be used or modified within that function
-   **Global Variables** have global scope -- for example, a variable delcared outside a function can be accessed or modified across multiple functions

## Global vs. Local variables (scope)

-   In the previous program we wrote (volume and area of sphere), `r`, `v` and `a` are local variables within the `main()` function.
-   The variable `radius` and `area` are local within the `sphere_area(radius)` function scope.
-   The variable `radius` and `volume` are local within `sphere_volume(radius)`

## Global or Local?

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
a = 10               # What are the global and local variables?
b = 5                # Is the output of the two programs the same 
                     # or different?
def sum():
  return a + b

def main():
  print(sum())
  
main()
```

vs.

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
def sum(a, b):
  return a + b

def main():
  print(sum(10, 5))
  
main()
```

## Argument vs. Parameter

-   Never set variables as global variables, pass values to functions when called
-   When a function is defined, the variables you want to pass to the function are called **parameter variables**
-   When the function is then called, the values you pass to the function are called **arguments**

## Argument or Parameter?

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# The parameters are a and b
def add(a, b):
    return a+b
  
# The arguments being passed through are 5 and 4
add(5, 4)
```


## Write a function

Write a Python function called `hypotenuse` that takes two arguments: `a` and `b` representing the length of the two non-hypotenuse sides of a right triangle.
The function should calculate the hypotenuse according to the Pythagorean theorem: $c = \sqrt(a^2 + b^2)$. Return it rounded at two decimals.

Test cases: `hypotenuse(3, 4)` should return `5.0`, `hypotenuse(10, 10)` should return `14.14`

Name your file `hypotenuse.py`

## Write a function

```{python}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
def sqrt(n):
  '''
  This function calculates the square root of a number
  Args:
    n: integer or float
  Returns:
    The square root of n
  '''
  return n**.5

def hypotenuse(a, b):
  '''
  This function calculates the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle.
  Args:
    a: number (integer or float) representing one of the non-hypotenuse sides
    b: number (integer or float) representing one of the non-hypotenuse sides
  Returns:
    Float representing the length of the hypotenuse given a and b
  ''' 
  h = sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
  return round(h, 2)

def main():
  '''
  This function calls the hypotenuse function to calculate and then
  print out the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle of sides 3 and 4
  and the hypotenuse of a right angle triange of sides 10 and 10
  '''
  result = hypotenuse(3, 4)
  print(result)
  
  result = hypotenuse(10, 10)
  print(result)
  
main()
```
