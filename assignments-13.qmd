# Programming Problem 23

**Due date: `r assignments %>% filter(assessment == "Module 12 Programming Problems") %>% pull(formatted_date)` at 7pm**

Write a Python function that does the following:

1.  Its name is `sum_nums`
2.  It takes two arguments: a list of list (2D list) of `integers` and `n` an integers
3.  It iterates through all of the numbers, and sum all of the ones whose value is less than `n`
4.  It returns the sum

Test cases:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
print( sum_nums([[2, 12, 2], [12, 5, 100, 9]], 10) ) # 18
print( sum_nums([[2, 12, 2], [10, 5, 10, 9]], 10) ) # 18
print( sum_nums([[2, 12, 2], [10, 5, 10, 9]], 0) ) # 0
print( sum_nums([], 10) ) # 0
```

Name the program `sums.py`. Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case.

# Programming Problem 24

**Due date: `r assignments %>% filter(number == 21) %>% pull(formatted_date)` at 7pm**

Write a Python function that does the following:

1.  Its name is `longest_string`
2.  It takes one argument: a list of dictionaries
3.  The keys in each dictionary could be of various types, but you may assume that the values will be strings
4.  It returns the longest string value from all of the dictionaries in the list

Test cases:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
data = [{'a':'horse', 'b':'caterpillar'}, {'a':'camp', 'c':'joker'}]
print( longest_string(data) ) # caterpillar

data = [{1:'abc', 5:'onetwothree'}, {2:'abcd'}, {7:'one two three'}]
print( longest_string(data) ) # one two three
```

Name the program `longest.py`. Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case.
