# CSC 110 Python Functions

## Write a function

Write a Python function that does the following:

1.  Its name is `greeting`
2.  It takes two arguments, `first_name` and `last_name`
3.  It returns a string with a greeting using `first_name` and `last_name`

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
print( greeting("Xinchen", "Yu") ) # Hello, Xinchen Yu!
```


## Reading the documentation

Access the [Python 3.11 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/functions.html#built-in-functions) and read the definitions for `print()`, `round()`, `input()`, `len()`, `int()`, and `str()`.

With your table members, write a short definition for each of the built-in functions above on a white board.
 
## `len()` function

-   The `len()` function can be used with many types -- we will be using it with `string` for now
-   It returns the number of characters in a string

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
character_count = len("Xinchen")
print(character_count)
```

## Write a function

Write a Python function that does the following:

1.  Its name is `count_characters`
2.  It takes a string argument, `name`
3.  It returns the total number of characters in `name`


```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
print( count_characters("Xinchen") ) # 7
print( count_characters("") ) # 0
print( count_characters(" ") ) # 1
print( count_characters("10") ) # 2
```


## `input()` function

-   The `input()` function prompts the user to input text in the standard output
-   Whatever is inside the parentheses in `input()` will be written to the standard output (without a trailing newline, which you can add using `\n`).
-   The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that
-   `input()` always returns a string

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
input("What's your name?\n")
```


## Write main()

Now you should have two functions in your `.py` script: `greeting` and `count_characters`.

Write a `main()` function.

## Write a function

In the same script, write `main()`:

1.  Prompt user to enter their first name and last name using `input()`
2.  Call your `greeting` function and save the string it returns to a variable
3.  Print the variable
4.  Call your `count_characters` function with the user's full name and save the integer value returned to a variable
5.  Print a message to the user: `Your full name has X letters.` -- replacing X with the right character count

## `input()` function

Use `input()` to get user input (it always returns a string)

## `int()` function

-   The `int()` function can be used to convert a string to an integer type
-   It only works if the string only contains digits

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
age = '35'
age_int = int(age)
print(type(age), type(age_int))
```

## `float()` function

-   The `float()` function can be used to convert a string to a float type
-   It only works if the string only contains digits and optionally a decimal point

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
age = '35'
age_float = float(age)
print(type(age), type(age_float))
```


## Write a function

Write a Python function that does the following:

1.  Its name is `calculate_year_born`, with no parameters
1.  It prompts user to enter their age `input()`
2.  It converts user's age to integer (since `input()` always returns a string)
3.  It calculates (imperfectly) the year a person of `age` was born by subtracting `age` from `2024`
4.  It returns an integer representing the approximate year person of `age` was born

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
print( calculate_year_born() ) # user enters 60, function returns 1964
```

## Attendence

Submit your calculate_year_born solution as attendance on Gradescope.

Name your file `get_input.py`

## Organizing your code

-   Split your functions and your `main()` in different files
-   Use `from script_name import *`
-   For gradescope, submit only your script with all of your functions
